# Car Rental System

## Project Overview
The **Car Rental System** is a Java-based application that allows users to rent and return cars. It manages a fleet of vehicles, tracks customers, handles rental and return processes, and calculates rental fees based on the number of rental days. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Features
- Add cars to the rental system with specific details such as brand, model, and base price per day.
- Rent a car to a customer and calculate the rental cost based on the duration of rental.
- Return a rented car and mark it as available for future rentals.
- Keep track of the cars, customers, and ongoing rentals.
- Console-based menu interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language used for developing the system.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The project uses OOP concepts such as classes, objects, and inheritance.
